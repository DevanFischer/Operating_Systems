# MAC OS vs Windows OS

#### CIS120 - Assignment06 - Devan Fischer

## MAC OS

### Advantages

- Ease of use and based off UNIX.
- Their Ecosystem provides excellent integration across all Apple devices. 
- Fewer viruses created due to fewer overall devices and Apples tightly controled enviroment.
- Generally Apple incorporates new innovations into devices faster than Windows such as USB-C.
- Can install and boot Windows on a Apple Machine using their "Bootcamp" utility.

### Disadvantages

- High price point
- Limit on OS customization
- Limited machine options due to only one manufacturer, Apple. 
- Machine is not intended for hardcore gamers.
- Generally unable to upgrade hardware after purchase.

## WINDOWS OS

### Advantages

- Much cheaper than Apple machines due to the wide range of manufactures.
- Can upgrade machines over time with new/better hardware such as more RAM.
- Plug and Play. Most devices can be plugged in and used without the need for any manual installs.
- Support for all hardware due to Windows much larger user base.
- Larger selection of available software, utilities, and games than MacOS or Linux.

### Disadvantages

- Many more virus attacks than MacOS. More people use windows so more people tend to try to hack it.
- Lacks specialized help without use of a third party support company.
- Tends to be less reliable than Linux or MacOS.
- If you want a fast machine you need to buy "high-end" expensive hardware. Windows is resource intensive.
- Closed Source code makes it hard for developers to fix bugs and troubleshoot the OS.


![MacOS System Info](/images/systeminfo.png "Screenshot of MacOS system info")

1. What operating system are you running (what type of device is it running on)?
I am running macOS Big Sur on a 2018 MacBook Pro

2. List at least one other item of information you see in the system information (such as amount of memory).
The laptop has 16 GB of memory and uses a Intel Core i7 processor.

3. State at least one reason why you might need to know the operating system version on your computer or mobile device.

## OS Functions

I would be useful to know the operating system so you know what functions and tools you have available to you.

One of the main operating system functions is processor management, also known as process scheduling. The OS decides the order in which processes have access to the processor and how much processing time each process has. This system keeps track of the status of processes and is known as the traffic controller. This function is critical in a multi programming enviroment as it allocates and de-allocates processor use when needed.

Another critial function of a computer is security. The use of a password and authorization provides and limits access to the system. This is used to protect user data, system configuaration, and system access. Computers without security functions are extremely vulnerable and should be secured immediately.

File management is the organization of files and directories for efficient navigation and usage. Directories can be many levels deep and can contain other directories. The operating system keeps track of where the information is stored, what access rights are available, the status of every file, and other important metadata. This function and set of facilities is known as the file system.
