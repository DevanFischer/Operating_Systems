#### CIS120 - Assignment06 - Devan Fischer

## MAC OS

### Advantages

- Ease of use and based off UNIX.
- Their Ecosystem provides excellent integration across all Apple devices. 
- Fewer viruses created due to fewer overall devices and Apples tightly controled enviroment.
- Generally Apple incorporates new innovations into devices faster than Windows such as USB-C.
- Can install and boot Windows on a Apple Machine using their "Bootcamp" utility.

### Disadvantages

- High price point
- Limit on OS customization
- Limited machine options due to only one manufacturer, Apple. 
- Machine is not intended for hardcore gamers.
- Generally unable to upgrade hardware after purchase.

## WINDOWS OS

### Advantages

- Much cheaper than Apple machines due to the wide range of manufactures.
- Can upgrade machines over time with new/better hardware such as more RAM.
- Plug and Play. Most devices can be plugged in and used without the need for any manual installs.
- Support for all hardware due to Windows much larger user base.
- Larger selection of available software, utilities, and games than MacOS or Linux.

### Disadvantages

- Many more virus attacks than MacOS. More people use windows so more people tend to try to hack it.
- Lacks specialized help without use of a third party support company.
- Tends to be less reliable than Linux or MacOS.
- If you want a fast machine you need to buy "high-end" expensive hardware. Windows is resource intensive.
- Closed Source code makes it hard for developers to fix bugs and troubleshoot the OS.
