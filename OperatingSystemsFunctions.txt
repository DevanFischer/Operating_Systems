One of the main operating system functions is processor management, also known as process scheduling. The OS decides the order in which processes have access to the processor and how much processing time each process has. This system keeps track of the status of processes and is known as the traffic controller. This function is critical in a multi programming enviroment as it allocates and de-allocates processor use when needed.

Another critial function of a computer is security. The use of a password and authorization provides and limits access to the system. This is used to protect user data, system configuaration, and system access. Computers without security functions are extremely vulnerable and should be secured immediately.
